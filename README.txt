DuckDuckGo Safari Extension
---------------------------

Very rudimentary Safari extension which installs a DuckDuckGo search bar.

I love DuckDuckGo and it always annoyed me that the plugin Glims had to be installed to add DuckDuckGo to the search bar. Unfortunately, Safari Extensions cannot alter the search bar (At least I don't think! Prove me wrong!) so this adds a new toolbar with a DuckDuckGo search in it.

Also worth noting, I committed the built extension, it is not necessary to have that in the extension folder to build it.

Additionally, you will need to sign up for a Safari Extension Certificate to build the extension. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, use DuckDuckGo to search for it!
